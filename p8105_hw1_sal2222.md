Problem 1
=========

This problem focuses on variable types and coercion.

Create a mixed class dataframe
------------------------------

First, I will create a data frame with a random sample from a uniform distribution, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2, a character vector, and a factor vector.

``` r
set.seed(1234)

random_sample <- runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)

logical_GT2 <- random_sample > 2

character10 <- c("Data", "science", "is", "the", "use", "of", "data", "to", "formulate", "and")

factor10 <- factor(c("green", "red", "red", "blue", "green", "blue", "green", "red", "red", "blue"))

constructed_df <- tibble(
  random_sample,
  logical_GT2,
  character10, 
  factor10
 )

constructed_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    random_sample logical_GT2 character10 factor10
    ##            <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>       <fct>   
    ##  1        0.569  FALSE       Data        green   
    ##  2        3.11   TRUE        science     red     
    ##  3        3.05   TRUE        is          red     
    ##  4        3.12   TRUE        the         blue    
    ##  5        4.30   TRUE        use         green   
    ##  6        3.20   TRUE        of          blue    
    ##  7        0.0475 FALSE       data        green   
    ##  8        1.16   FALSE       to          red     
    ##  9        3.33   TRUE        formulate   red     
    ## 10        2.57   TRUE        and         blue

Variable means
--------------

I will attempt to take the mean of each variable in my dataframe.

``` r
mean(random_sample)
```

    ## [1] 2.446132

``` r
mean(logical_GT2)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(character10)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(character10): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(factor10)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(factor10): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

*What works and what doesnâ€™t? Why?*

The random uniform distribution sample vector works because you can calculate the mean from the numeric class. The logical vector works because mean returns the proportion of "TRUE" observations. The charcter and factor vectors do not work. Both variables return "NA" because their class is neither numeric nor logical.

Apply as.numeric function
-------------------------

*Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables. What happens?*

``` r
as.numeric(logical_GT2)
as.numeric(character10)
as.numeric(factor10)
```

For the logical variable, the `as.numeric` function converts "TRUEs" and "FALSEs" to "1s" and "0s", respectively.

The `as.numeric` function does not work for the character variable. "NAs" are introduced by coersion for each observation.

For the factor variable, the `as.numeric` function assigns an integer for each unique level. In my example, "blue" is changed to "1", "green" is changed to "2", and "red" is changed to "3".

Multiple class conversions
--------------------------

*Convert your character variable from character to factor to numeric; similarly, convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric. What happens?*

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(character10))
as.numeric(as.character(factor10))
```

Converting my character variable from character to factor to numeric assigned a unique level to each character and converted the levels to integers from 1 to 10.

Converting my factor variable from factor to character to numeric returns "NAs" by coersion for each observation since the character strings cannot be converted to numeric values.

    ##  [1]  3  7  5  8 10  6  2  9  4  1

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

Problem 2
=========

This problem focuses on plotting and the use of inline R code.

Create a mixed class data frame
-------------------------------

I will create a data frame comprised of two random samples from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether the sum of the random samples is greater than 0, and numeric and factor vectors derived from the logical vector. The first 10 rows of the data frame are displayed.

``` r
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(1000)

set.seed(2)
y <- rnorm(1000)

logical_sum_xy <- x + y > 0

numeric_from_logical <- as.numeric(logical_sum_xy)

factor_from_logical <- as.factor(logical_sum_xy)

five_variable_df <- tibble(
  x,
  y,
  logical_sum_xy,
  numeric_from_logical,
  factor_from_logical
)

five_variable_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,000 x 5
    ##         x       y logical_sum_xy numeric_from_logical factor_from_logical
    ##     <dbl>   <dbl> <lgl>                         <dbl> <fct>              
    ##  1 -0.626 -0.897  FALSE                             0 FALSE              
    ##  2  0.184  0.185  TRUE                              1 TRUE               
    ##  3 -0.836  1.59   TRUE                              1 TRUE               
    ##  4  1.60  -1.13   TRUE                              1 TRUE               
    ##  5  0.330 -0.0803 TRUE                              1 TRUE               
    ##  6 -0.820  0.132  FALSE                             0 FALSE              
    ##  7  0.487  0.708  TRUE                              1 TRUE               
    ##  8  0.738 -0.240  TRUE                              1 TRUE               
    ##  9  0.576  1.98   TRUE                              1 TRUE               
    ## 10 -0.305 -0.139  FALSE                             0 FALSE              
    ## # ... with 990 more rows

Description of dataset vectors
------------------------------

*The following is a short description of my data, including: the size of the dataset, the mean and median of x, the proportion of cases for which the logical vector is TRUE.*

The data frame `five_variable_df` has 1000 rows and 5 columns.

The length of variable `x` is 1000. The mean of `x` is -0.0116481. The median of `x` is -0.0353242.

The proportion of cases for which the logical vector `logical_sum_xy` is "TRUE" is 0.506.
